# IBMWatson-Virtual-Voice-Assistant
This is my first big project. It is my 10th grade personal project. This utilizes the IBM Watson text to speech voice along with the VLC package to create a realistic voice assistant. It has a key word recognition system. This virtual assistant is capable of news, weather, internet searches, advanced calculations with complicated problems, taking notes, and so much more. The goal was to have a similar feel to Jarvis from Iron man. The goal was definitely achieved with such a realistic yet intelligent sounding voice. It's design is simple but effective and it does as intended.
