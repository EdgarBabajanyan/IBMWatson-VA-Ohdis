# IBMWatson-Virtual-Voice-Assistant

I participated in the CT-Stem Science Fair and participated in the LT. Governors Computing Challenge with this project.

The mission for this project was to create a virtual assistant that can provide the exact same information Alexa or Google can provide without the need for recordings or data tracking for self improvement. 

In the process of working on the project, I created something called "Voice Box" or the use of a voice API and directly streaming it through an audio player backend to give the impression of a talkling voice assistant.

This utilizes the IBM Watson text to speech voice along with the VLC package to create a realistic voice assistant. It has a key word recognition system. This virtual assistant is capable of news, weather, internet searches, advanced calculations with complicated problems, taking notes, and so much more. The goal was to have a similar feel to Jarvis from Iron man. The goal was definitely achieved with such a realistic yet intelligent sounding voice. It's design is simple but effective and it does as intended.
